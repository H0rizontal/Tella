/**
 * The store holds the user's consents to the different `Feature`s and `Campaign`s, and their `Visit`
 * and `Event` measurements.
 *
 * If you want to implement your own persistence of the store (e.g. because you want to write it in a
 * database instead of the file system) and your own implementation of the transmission to the
 * Matomo/CIMP backend (e.g. because you want to tunnel the requests through a proxy or add your own
 * encryption layer), then create a subclass of this class and and implement the `#init`, `#persist`
 * and `#send` methods.
 *
 * If you only want to change either one or the other, you can use `DefaultStore` as a base and work
 * from there.
 *
 * @param args
 *      Optional arguments your implementation might need for loading the store.
 * @param debug
 *      Optional function to output debug messages.
