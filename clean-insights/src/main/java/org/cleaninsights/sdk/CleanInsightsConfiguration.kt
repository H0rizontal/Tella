/**
 * @param server
 *      The server URL should look like `https://myhost.example.com/ci/cleaninsights.php`.
 *
 * @param siteId
 *      The Matomo site ID to record this data for.
 *
 * @param campaigns
 *      Campaign configuration.
 *
 * @param timeout
 *      Connection timeout. OPTIONAL, defaults to 5 seconds.
 *
 * @param maxRetryDelay
 *      The SDK uses a truncated exponential backoff strategy on server failures. So the delay until
 *      it retries will rise exponentially, until it reaches `maxRetryDelay` seconds.
 *      OPTIONAL, defaults to 3600 seconds. (1 hour)
 *
 * @param maxAgeOfOldData
 *      The number in days of how long the SDK will try to keep sending old measurements.
 *      If the measurements become older than that, they will be purged.
 *      OPTIONAL, defaults to 100 days.
 *
 * @param persistEveryNTimes
 *      Regulates, how often data persistence is done. OPTIONAL. Defaults to 10.
 *      If set to 1, every time something is tracked, *ALL* data is stored to disk. The more you track,
 *      the higher you should set this to avoid heavy load due to disk I/O.
 *
 * @param serverSideAnonymousUsage
 *      When set to true, assumes consent for all campaigns and none for features.
 *      Only use this, when you're running on the server and don't measure anything users
 *      might need to give consent to!
 *
 * @param debug
 *      When set, CleanInsights SDK will print some debug output to STDOUT. OPTIONAL. Defaults to false.
