/**
 * This class keeps track of all granted or denied consents of a user.
 *
 * There are two different types of consents:
 * - Consents for common features like if we're allowed to evaluate the locale or a user agent.
 * - Consents per measurement campaign.
 *
 * The time of the consent is recorded along with it's state: If it was actually granted or denied.
 *
 * Consents for common features are given indefinitely, since they are only ever recorded along with
 * running campaigns.
 *
 * Consents for campaigns only last for a certain amount of days.
