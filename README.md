Tella is a documentation app for Android. In challenging environments--with limited or no internet connectivity or in the face of repression--Tella makes it easier and safer to document events, whether thatâ€™s violence, human rights violations, corruption, or electoral fraud.

Tella is used by:
- Activists, organizers and human rights defenders to safely document events in their communities, produce reliable and verifiable evidence, and store data encrypted on their mobile devices
- Media, professional reporters and citizen journalists to store sensitive media files encrypted as they travel, particularly as they cross borders
- Civil society professionals and humanitarian workers to conduct interviews and collect data in poorly connected environments or in conflict areas
- Electoral observation and monitoring organizations to monitor elections from inside and outside polling stations in real time and expose electoral fraud
- Research institutions and international organizations to conduct research, interviews or surveys in challenging environments, particularly in conflict areas
